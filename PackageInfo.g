##  Status information. Currently the following cases are recognized:

##    "deposited"     for packages for which the GAP developers agreed

##  For a central overview of all packages and a collection of all package
##  archives it is necessary to have two files accessible which should be
##  contained in each package:
##     - A README file, containing a short abstract about the package
##       content and installation instructions.
##     - The file you are currently reading or editing!
##  You must specify URLs for these two files, these allow to automate 
##  the updating of package information on the GAP Website, and inclusion
##  and updating of the package in the GAP distribution.

##  On the GAP Website there is an online version of all manuals in the
##  GAP distribution. To handle the documentation of a package it is
##  necessary to have:
##     - an archive containing the package documentation (in at least one 
##       of HTML or PDF-format, preferably both formats)
##     - the start file of the HTML documentation (if provided), *relative to
##       package root*
##     - the PDF-file (if provided) *relative to the package root*
##  For links to other package manuals or the GAP manuals one can assume 
##  relative paths as in a standard GAP installation. 
##  Also, provide the information which is currently given in your packages 
##  init.g file in the command DeclarePackage(Auto)Documentation
##  (for future simplification of the package loading mechanism).
##  
##  Please, don't include unnecessary files (.log, .aux, .dvi, .ps, ...) in
##  the provided documentation archive.
